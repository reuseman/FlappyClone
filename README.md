# About the project
The project is a clone of [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). It was written in Java 8 using the Swing library in 2017 for a final project at my university. It was just a stylistic exercise to reach a specific objective through coding.

## Instructions

 1. Execute `FlappyBird.java`.
 2. The main menu will load and `space` can be pressed to start the game.
 3. Press space to jump.
 4. Restart the game by pressing `enter` or go back to the main menu by pressing `esc`.

### For developers
I disabled the sound because some troubles with the library happened. The logic for the sound is implemented, so to make it available you just need to read the sound and play it with a different library.
